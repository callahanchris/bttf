# 88 mph with Flux and React

A basic app I built to go along with my [blog post](http://callahanchris.github.io/blog/2014/11/23/88-mph-with-flux-and-react/) on Flux and React.js.

To run this on your computer, clone the repo locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/callahanchris/bttf
```

Install the npm modules:

```
npm install
```

Build the bundle.js file:

```
npm run build
```

And check out the app in a web browser!

```
open index.html
```
